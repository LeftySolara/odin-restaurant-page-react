# Restaurant Page (React Version)

This is a recreation of my solution to the [Restaurant Homepage exercise](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page) from the Odin Project's [Full Stack Javascript track](https://www.theodinproject.com/tracks/2).

This version uses React for the front end. The assignment specs can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/frameworks).
